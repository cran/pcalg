\description{
Convert a DAG to an (interventional or observational) essential graph.
}
\usage{
dag2essgraph(dag, targets = list(integer(0)))
}
\arguments{
  \item{dag}{The DAG whose essential graph has to be calculated.  Different
    representations are possible: \code{dag} can be an 
    object of \code{\link[graph]{graphNEL}} (package \pkg{graph}) or 
    an instance of a class derived from \code{\linkS4class{ParDAG}}.}
  
  \item{targets}{List of intervention targets with respect to which the 
    essential graph has to be calculated.  An observational setting is
    represented by one single empty target (\code{list(integer(0))}).}
}
\details{
  This function converts a DAG to its corresponding (interventional or 
  observational) essential graph, using the algorithm of Hauser and Bühlmann
  (2012).
  
  The essential graph is a partially directed graph that represents the
  (interventional or observational) Markov equivalence class of a DAG.  It has
  the same has the same skeleton as the DAG; a directed edge represents an
  arrow that has a common orientation in all representatives of the 
  (interventional or observational) Markov equivalence class, whereas an
  undirected edge represents an arrow that has different orientations in
  different representatives of the equivalence class.  In the observational 
  case, the essential graph is also known as ``CPDAG'' (Spirtes \emph{et al.},
  2000).
  
  In a purely observational setting (\emph{i.e.}, if \code{targets = 
  list(integer(0))}), the function yields the same graph as 
  \code{\link{dag2cpdag}}.
}
\value{
  Depending on the class of \code{dag}, the essential graph is returned as
  \itemize{
    \item{an instance of \code{\link[graph]{graphNEL}}, if \code{dag} is an 
      instance of \code{graphNEL},}
    \item{an instance of \code{\linkS4class{EssGraph}}, if \code{dag} is
      an instance of a class derived from \code{\linkS4class{ParDAG}}.}
  }

p <- 10     # Number of random variables

## Generate a random DAG

## Calculate observational essential graph

## Calculate interventional essential graph for intervention targets
## {1} and {3}
